JavaFX based desktop application.

Goal is to provide an interface for data structures and algorithims that is more intuitive and visual.

Right now, Bubble sort and Quick sort are implemented. I was playing around with some 2 dimensional physics in DataBox Gravity. (They aren't turned on easily)

TODO:
Make the physics a button.

Properly label the side bar buttons.

Implement linked list and tree visualizations.
